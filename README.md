# dotfilez
Updated dotfiles this time with i3, sowm etc

## install:
please note that everything is installed for **`/home/koutsie/`** , not your current install.
i will get an propper installer when i get to it.

`curl -fsSL https://git.io/Je6fO | bash`


### Notes:

> Everything in `sowm` has been configured to work for me, so please do look around before complaining about stuff not working.


> Brightness controls have been configured for an amdgpu laptop, please make sure to change those to match your own solution.


> Volume changing uses `pamixer` and only changes the current output, please make sure to edit as needed.


> Wallpaper changer uses unsplash's url api, please make sure to change it to your liking (currently: `nature` & `water` tags are used).
