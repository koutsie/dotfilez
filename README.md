# dotfilez
Updated dotfiles this time with i3, sowm etc


### Notes:

> Everything in `sowm` has been configured to work for me, so please do look around before complaining about stuff not working.


> Brightness controls have been configured for an amdgpu laptop, please make sure to change those to match your own solution.


> Volume changing uses `pamixer` and only changes the current output, please make sure to edit as needed.


> Wallpaper changer uses unsplash's url api, please make sure to change it to your liking (currently: `nature` & `water` tags are used).


## Depencies/Configured programs so far:
- flameshot
- pamixer
- wget
- curl
- mpsyt

## Editors:
For nano: https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc
For geany: `tango light` with `sourcecode variable bold`
